\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A class to implement a \doxylink{classPID}{PID} controller. 

The \doxylink{classPID}{PID} class provides methods to set \doxylink{classPID}{PID} coefficients, compute the output value, and set limits for the output value. It also provides getter and setter methods for the \doxylink{classPID}{PID} coefficients.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The compute method should be called periodically to update the output value.
