# Temperature Control Hardware

## How It Works

### Components and Their Parameters

ðŸ”¹ **BC547 Transistor**
- Acts as an intermediate driver.
- Receives a 3.3V control signal from the ESP32 through a resistor.
- Activates the circuit, allowing 5V to flow through the LED of the MOC3052 optotriac.

ðŸ”¹ **MOC3052 Optotriac**
- Triggered by the BC547 transistor.
- Connected via a 1kÎ© resistor to the BTA24 (or BT138) triac.
- Provides safe 220V switching.

ðŸ”¹ **BTA24 (or BT138) Triac**
- Ideal for resistive loads like heaters.
- High current handling capabilities.

ðŸ”¹ **PC817 Optotransistor**
- Used for zero-cross detection.
- Connected with two 51kÎ© resistors to the AC mains.
- Allows the ESP32 to detect the exact moment when voltage crosses zero and synchronize the triac switching accordingly.

## Hardware Implementation

ðŸ›  **Components:**
- **ESP32** from Espressif Systems as the main controller.
- **BC547 Transistor** for optotriac triggering.
- **MOC3052 Optotriac** for galvanic isolation.
- **PC817 Optotransistor** for zero-cross detection.
- **BTA24 or BT138 Triac** for handling high-current loads.
- **Rectifier Circuit** to power the ESP32 from 220V AC.
- **Fuse** for additional protection.
